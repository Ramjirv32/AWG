# ðŸŽ‰ AWG Dashboard - Latest Updates

## What's New

### ðŸ¤– IoT Data Simulator (Multi-User Support)

**Backend Enhancement:**
- Created advanced IoT simulator (`backend/utils/iotSimulator.js`)
- Simulates sensor data every 10 seconds
- **NEW:** Simulates water consumption for multiple users automatically
- Realistic daily consumption patterns (peak hours: 7-9 AM, 12-2 PM, 6-9 PM)
- Random error generation with various severity levels
- User-specific socket rooms for personalized real-time updates

**How it works:**
1. Backend generates sensor data globally (shared across all users)
2. Randomly selects 1-3 users every 30 seconds
3. Simulates water consumption (100-500ml) for selected users
4. Sends real-time updates to specific users via Socket.io rooms
5. Users see their hydration tracker update automatically

### ðŸ’§ Enhanced Water Consumption Tracking

**New Features:**
- **Quick Log Buttons:** One-click logging for 250ml, 500ml, 750ml, 1000ml
- **Recent Activity Feed:** See your last 10 water intake logs in real-time
- **Type Selection:** Track different types of consumption (drinking, cooking, cleaning, other)
- **Real-time Updates:** Hydration tracker updates automatically when you or the simulator logs water
- **Visual Icons:** Different icons for different consumption types

**Improvements:**
- Socket.io integration for instant updates
- Better UX with quick-log buttons
- Activity history with timestamps
- Type categorization

### ðŸ‘¥ Community Page (Fully Functional)

## Technical Details

### IoT Simulator Logic

```javascript
// Runs every 10 seconds
simulateSensorData() {
  - Generate random sensor readings
  - Save to database
  - Emit to all connected clients
  - 5% chance to generate random error
}

// Runs every 30 seconds
simulateDailyPattern() {
  - Check current hour
  - Higher frequency during peak hours
  - Select 1-3 random users
  - Log 100-500ml water for each
  - Emit to specific user rooms
}
```

### Socket.io Room System

```javascript
// Client joins room on login
socket.emit('join', userId);

// Server sends to specific user
io.to(userId).emit('consumptionUpdate', data);

// Client receives personalized updates
socket.on('consumptionUpdate', () => {
  refreshHydrationData();
});
```

## Benefits

## Notes

**CSS Lint Warnings:**
- The `@theme` and `@apply` warnings in `index.css` are expected
- These are Tailwind v4 directives
- They work perfectly with `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin
- Safe to ignore these warnings

**Simulator Behavior:**
- Only runs in development mode
- Automatically disabled in production
- Can be customized in `backend/utils/iotSimulator.js`
- Frequency and patterns can be adjusted

## Troubleshooting

### Water not updating automatically?
1. Check if backend is running
2. Verify Socket.io connection in browser console
3. Make sure you're logged in
4. Check Network tab for WebSocket connection

### Quick log not working?
1. Ensure you're on the Consumption page
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify API endpoint is accessible
4. Try manual log to test API

### Community page not showing?
1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check if route is added in App.jsx
4. Verify Sidebar has the link
